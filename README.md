Deploy Like A Boss
------------------

The way Heroku has changed the deploying of web application is impressive,
but also if the code is open source in some cases is not allowed to use
their stack (containers, git repository on the remote side etc...) so
these are scripts to manage deploying having only ssh access to the
remote machine.
